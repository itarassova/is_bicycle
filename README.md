is_bicycle is the data analysis of new annotators dataset gathering insights about annotators and evaluating quality and performance of the new crowd. The data analysis is contained in Jupyter notebook which can be run in any preferred way (I ran Jupyter Notebook in AWS Sagemaker Studio Lab with default:Python kernel). The required dependencies are listed in 'requirements.txt' file. The required json files 'anonymized_project.json' and 'references.json' should be uploaded into the same folder as the Jupyter notebook 'is_bicycle.ipynb'.
